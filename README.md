# Story Foundry

**An AI-Powered Novel Writing Assistant Framework**

Story Foundry is an innovative agentic collaboration system that partners with authors to write novels through a structured, AI-assisted creative process. Unlike traditional writing tools, Story Foundry employs multiple specialized AI subagents working together to guide authors through every stage of novel creation‚Äîfrom initial brainstorming to final manuscript.

## ‚ú® What Makes Story Foundry Unique

- **Agentic Collaboration**: A team of specialized AI subagents, each expert in different aspects of storytelling
- **Structured Workflow**: A proven three-stage process that transforms ideas into finished novels
- **Story Theory Foundation**: Built on established frameworks from experts like Shawn Coyne's "Story Grid" and other renowned writing methodologies
- **Author-Centric**: Captures and preserves the author's unique voice and intent throughout the process
- **Project Organization**: Manages multiple novel projects with comprehensive story bibles and structured content

## üéØ The Three-Stage Workflow

### 1. **Capture Stage**
*Brainstorming and idea collection*

- **Purpose**: Exhaust the author's ideas through guided brainstorming sessions
- **Process**: Authors dump ideas, concepts, and inspiration while AI subagents help explore and expand
- **Subagents**: archivist, wildcard-generator, idea-generator, backstory-expert, plot-expert
- **Output**: Raw creative content, character concepts, world-building elements

### 2. **Distillation Stage**  
*Organizing ideas into coherent structure*

- **Purpose**: Transform raw ideas into structured outlines and story architecture
- **Process**: AI subagents analyze and organize content into coherent narrative structures
- **Subagents**: story-architect, scene-architect, archivist, researcher, editor
- **Output**: Story outlines, scene cards, narrative structure documents

### 3. **Production Stage**
*Writing and refining the manuscript*

- **Purpose**: Collaborate on actual prose writing and content refinement
- **Process**: AI subagents assist with scene writing, editing, and maintaining consistency
- **Subagents**: scene-architect, continuity-expert, dialogue-expert, editor, writer-author
- **Output**: Draft scenes, final manuscript sections, editorial feedback

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each novel project follows a standardized organization system:

```
projects/
  [project-name]/
    author-notes/           # Session recordings and raw author input
      session-notes-[###].md
    content/                # Finalized story materials
      outlines/             # Approved story and scene outlines
      drafts/               # Working manuscript drafts
      manuscript/           # Final manuscript files
    workspace/              # Active work area for current session
      # Capture stage files:
      setting.md
      characters.md
      session-notes.md
      # Distillation stage files:
      full-story-outline.md
      full-scene-outline.md
      story-card-[##].md
      # Production stage files:
      agent-draft.md
      critique.md
      fix_spec.md
      agent-draft-rev.md
      editor_log.md
    story-bible.json        # Comprehensive story reference
    README.md               # Project-specific documentation
```

Each project maintains a comprehensive `story-bible.json` that serves as the canonical reference for:

- **Voice Specification**: Writing style guidelines and comparable authors
- **Canon**: Setting, era, technology, and world rules
- **Characters**: Detailed profiles with goals, wounds, and development arcs  
- **Constraints**: POV, tense, and technical writing parameters
- **Plot Elements**: A-story, B-story, C-story tracking
- **Research Notes**: Reference materials and inspiration sources
