# Sci-Fi: Obligatory Scenes & Conventions

## Conventions

- **Speculative Premise**: A “what if” idea (AI, space travel, time manipulation, alien contact).
- **Scientific/Technological Innovation**: Central to the world and plot.
- **Extrapolated Logic**: Science or technology grounded in plausible reasoning.
- **World-Building**: New societies, laws, ecosystems, or political structures shaped by tech.
- **Sense of Wonder & Discovery**: Awe, novelty, scale, or paradigm-shifting revelations.
- **Moral/Philosophical Questions**: Humanity’s place in cosmos, ethics of innovation, identity.
- **Social Commentary**: Reflects contemporary concerns (colonialism, surveillance, inequality).

## Scenes

- **We’re Not in Kansas Anymore:** We must learn early on that this universe differs from ours because it has some magic/tech that our universe does not.
- **Rules of the Universe:** We must have some insight into how the magic/tech works—not the mechanics of it, but the global rules, such as who can use it, what it allows, etc.
- **All Magic Has a Price:** There must be limitations to the magic/tech, a cost to using it.
- **Magic Makes Trouble:** The magic/tech must shape the character and/or society in a way that drives the plot. The magic/tech or the society it enables, creates the problem.
- **Confrontation with the Consequences:** The character faces human/ethical impact.
- **Magic Aides the Hero:** The magic/tech must also be relevant to how the problem is solved. (Even if the solution involves destroying it, as in Forbidden Planet, or being destroyed by it, as in 1984.)
- **Restoration/Transformation** Society, world, or protagonist irrevocably changed.
