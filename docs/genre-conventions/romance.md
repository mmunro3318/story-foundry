# Romance: Obligatory Scenes and Conventions

## Conventions

- **Protagonists Seeking/Resisting Love**: Each with internal wounds or flaws.
- **Meet Cute**: Unique/meaningful introduction of love interests.
- **Obstacles to Union**: Internal (fear, trauma) and external (family, society).
- **Emotional Intimacy**: Shared vulnerability, growth.
- **Rival or Temptation**: External pressure to abandon the relationship.
- **Mutual Recognition**: Love as choice, not accident.
- **Happy (or Bittersweet) Ending**: HEA (Happily Ever After) or HFN (Happy For Now).

## Scenes

- **The Cute Meet:** Meeting the each other is an unusual, even life-changing event, or occurs during some life-changing event. (If they knew each other long ago, this is replaced by an Unexpected Reunion. Sometimes, the Cute Meet is included too, as a prologue or a flashback.)
- **Proof of Attraction:** (gestures, banter, growing interest).
- **The External Problem:** Something outside the heroine and hero keeps them apart.
- **The Internal Problem:** Some internal wound keeps the heroine and hero apart.
- **The Draw:** Despite the problems, something forces the heroine and hero to spend time together.
- **The First Kiss:** The heroine and hero express their attraction for the first time.
- **The First Fight:** The heroine and hero quarrel, but overcome their difficulty.
- **The Commitment:** The heroine and hero admit to loving one another or in some way commit to one another.
- **The Betrayal:** Despite their commitment, either the external force or internal force keeping the lover apart threatens to separate them forever. There seems to be no way to overcome this.
- **Proof of Love / Grand Gesture** (protagonist risks vulnerability to prove love).
- **Love Conquers All:** The heroine and hero overcome the betrayal, proving the strength of their commitment (even, in a tragedy like Romeo and Juliet, or a romance without a HEA like The Titanic or The Notebook) despite death. In other almost-romances, or romances involving very young teens, an ambiguous “happily ever after for now” is acceptable.
- **The Happily Ever After (HEA):** In a true sits-on-the-romance-shelf genre Romance, as opposed to a strongly romantic story that might end tragically, the hero and heroine remain in love, remain together, and remain alive: they live happily ever after. Their HEA may be confirmed in an epilogue, or whenever the couple shows up in later books (about other couples) of the same series.
