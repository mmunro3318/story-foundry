# Horror: Obligatory Scenes & Conventions

## Conventions

- **Monster**: The villain is far more powerful than the hero, possibly even supernatural.
- **Indomnitable**: The Monster can’t be reasoned with
- **Isolation**: Physical/emotional/social; characters cut off from aid.
- **Normal Dude**: Non-heroic Protagonist forced to pursue saving their own life
- **Inevitable Confrontation**: The horror can’t be ignored forever.
- **Questions of Morality**: Who deserves survival? Who is complicit?

## Obligatory Scenes

0. **Fate Worse Than Death** Something more than life is at stake. A fate worse than death is possible, such as torture or damnation.
1. **Reveal** (first glimpse of unnatural or terrifying element).
2. **Protagonist Denial or Skepticism** (downplays or rationalizes fear).
3. **First Victim** (stakes become real).
4. **Confrontation with the Horror** (characters can’t escape).
5. **Speech in Praise of the Villain** Early one, someone describes how insurmountably powerful and/or awesomely evil the monster is.
6. **Hero at the Mercy of the Villain** There’s a scene near the climax where the protagonist seems to be utterly powerless against the villain.
7. **Climactic Final Stand** (fight, flight, or succumbing).
8. **Double/False Ending** There is a false ending where the villain seems defeated, but isn’t, followed by the real defeat of the (real) villain.
