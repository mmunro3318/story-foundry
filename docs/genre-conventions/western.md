# Western: Obligatory Scenes & Conventions

## Conventions

- **Frontier Setting**: Lawless edges of civilization.
- **Conflict Between Civilization & Wilderness**: Order vs. chaos, progress vs. nature.
- **Moral Ambiguity**: Anti-heroes, outlaws, corrupt officials.
- **Code of Honor**: Personal justice outside formal law.
- **Landscape as Character**: Vast, harsh, shaping human fate.
- **Guns & Violence**: Central to justice and survival.
