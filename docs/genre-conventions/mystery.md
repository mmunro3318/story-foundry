# Mystery: Obligatory Scenes & Conventions

- **The Crime:** A crime is committed—usually a murder.
- **The Crime as Trigger:** The crime must occur reasonably early in the story.
- **The Criminal Mastermind:** The criminal must be clever enough to have hidden his identity sufficiently that it’s not obvious from the start who committed the crime.
- **The Detective:** The investigator must be clever enough to solve the crime. If he’s not a professional (cop, PI), he must have some special skill or knack that helps him uncover clues others miss.
- **Now It’s Personal:** At some point, the investigation becomes personal for the investigator.
- **Clues & Red Herrings:** The investigator finds clues, but some clues are red herrings.
- **J’accuse:** The investigator uncovers/confronts/denounces the criminal.
- **Justice Theme:** The ending results in justice, injustice, or ironic justice.
