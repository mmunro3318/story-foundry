# 📜 Project Changelog

A running log of meaningful updates to this story’s files, packets, and structure.

> Maintained by the **archivist** (usually via `/archive_session`).

## [2025-09-19] – Session Kickoff

- Initialized project with `/story-init`.
- Added `story-bible.json` and base folders.
- Captured early brainstorming notes.

---

## [YYYY-MM-DD] – Session Summary

- Short bullet describing the main change.
- Another bullet (e.g., added scene cards, new packet, outline revisions).
- Optional: reference command used (`/outline_scene`, `/revise_scene`).

---

### Guidelines

- One header per working session (`## [date] – Title`).
- 3–6 bullets max: focus on _what changed_ and _why_.
- For packet edits, include filename and “Last Updated” field if you touched `INDEX.md`.
