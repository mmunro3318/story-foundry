# Swain: Motivation–Reaction Units

> **Purpose:** Help scene-level agents maintain believable cause-and-effect at the paragraph / sentence level.

---

## 1️⃣ Core Idea

- MRUs = _atomic chain of action & response_ that mimic human cognition.
- Keep reader inside the story by presenting stimulus → response in the order people actually experience it.

> **Agent Tip:** When prose feels “jerky” or unearned, check MRU order.

## 2️⃣ MRU Anatomy

| Component                     | Function                                         | Timing       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| **Motivation**                | External, observable event triggering a response | Instant      |
| **Reaction: Feeling**         | Involuntary emotion / sensation                  | Milliseconds |
| **Reaction: Reflex**          | Automatic movement / physical cue                | Split-second |
| **Reaction: Rational Action** | Conscious decision, speech, or deliberate act    | After reflex |

**Golden Rule:** Never put analysis before visceral reaction — readers unconsciously know the right order.

---

## 3️⃣ Usage in Prose

- **writer-author:** Draft paragraphs as `Motivation → [Feeling → Reflex → Action → Speech]`.
- **scene-architect:** When outlining, note potential _stimulus–response_ beats.
- **editor:** Flag inversions (e.g., character speaks before feeling).

### Example

```
Motivation: “The window shattered.”
Feeling: “Heat raced up Sam’s neck.”
Reflex: “He ducked.”
Rational Action: “Sam grabbed the poker.”
Speech: “Get down!”
```

## 4️⃣ Troubleshooting

| Problem             | Likely Fix                              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Flat response       | Add visceral _Feeling_ or _Reflex_ step |
| Confusing paragraph | Reorder beats into proper chain         |
| Over-explaining     | Trim analysis; trust sensory beats      |
