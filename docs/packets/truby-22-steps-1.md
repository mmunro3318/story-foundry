# Truby: Core Philosophy & Seven Key Steps

> **Purpose:** Equip structural agents with an at-a-glance guide to Truby’s organic narrative model and the “Story DNA.”

---

## 1️⃣ Core Philosophy — Story as Living System

- Story is an **organic body**, not a mechanical plot.
- Elements interact like organs: character, moral argument, plot, world, symbol web.
- **Moral argument** is the “brain” — every element should illuminate it.
- Structure emerges from _character need_, not formulas.

> **Agent Tip:** When planning, check if every beat supports the moral spine.

## 2️⃣ The Seven Key Steps (“Story DNA”)

| #   | Step            | Function                              |
| --- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Weakness & Need | Inner flaw (psych) + moral blind spot |
| 2   | Desire          | Concrete goal born from need          |
| 3   | Opponent        | Force resisting change                |
| 4   | Plan            | Strategy to pursue desire             |
| 5   | Battle          | Climax test of values                 |
| 6   | Self-Revelation | Hero sees truth about self            |
| 7   | New Equilibrium | Life reshaped by insight              |

> **For scene-architect:** Map scenes to which “step” they advance.  
> **For plot-expert:** Use steps as checklist for missing story functions.

## 3️⃣ Practical Use

- Use this packet instead of the full primer when building outlines.
- Keep steps tied to _human action + ethical stakes_.
- For scene-architect: keep step → beat mapping clear in cards.
- When in doubt: “Does this moment reveal need/desire or test values?”
