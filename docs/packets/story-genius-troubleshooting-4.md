# Story Genius: Troubleshooting & Genre Adaptations

> **Purpose:** Give editors and story engineers a quick “clinic” for diagnosing weak spots in drafts, plus guidance for adapting Cron’s model across genres.

---

## 1️⃣ Diagnostic Playbook

| Symptom                    | Likely Cause                                           | Fix                                              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Story feels episodic       | Missing **Third Rail** — scenes not tied to misbelief. | Revisit misbelief; add stakes linking scenes.    |
| Hero’s arc feels forced    | Misbelief not grounded in authentic backstory.         | Return to origin & crossroads scenes.            |
| Scenes lack momentum       | No clear _cause → effect_ chain.                       | Apply 4Q test; prune filler.                     |
| Emotional beats don’t land | Reaction happens off-page or too late.                 | Insert visceral reaction before analysis/action. |
| Info-dump dialogue         | Characters talk without stakes.                        | Give conversation risk tied to wound.            |

## 2️⃣ Genre Integration

### Mystery / Thriller

- External puzzle = mirror for protagonist’s wound.
- Solutions must resolve both **case** and **inner flaw**.

### Romance

- Identify whose arc is primary (Highlander rule).
- Romantic obstacles = expressions of each character’s misbelief about love.

### SFF / Speculative

- Treat worldbuilding as pressure on wound, not just backdrop.
- Technology/magic should complicate or tempt hero’s worldview.

## 3️⃣ Agent Usage

- **editor:** Use table to triage scene or arc issues.
- **plot-expert:** When genre is involved, ensure conflicts still aim at misbelief.
- **scene-architect:** Adjust cards to include stakes or reveals specific to genre norms.
