# Swain: Scenes & Sequels

> **Purpose:** Provide a concise, agent-ready guide to Dwight V. Swain’s “binary story engine” — how scenes and sequels alternate to maintain momentum and meaning.

---

## 1️⃣ Core Principle

- Narrative is a chain of **cause & effect** built from two units:
  - **Scene** → proactive, external problem-solving.
  - **Sequel** → reactive, internal processing.
- Alternating them keeps tension + emotional logic alive.

> **Agent Tip:** Each block should leave the hero either _set back_ or _changed_.

## 2️⃣ Scene Engine (Proactive)

| Beat     | Function                                     | Notes for Agents                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Goal     | Clear, measurable aim for the POV character. | State in one sentence.                 |
| Conflict | Progressive resistance to that goal.         | 3+ exchanges if possible.              |
| Disaster | Outcome that complicates pursuit.            | Use “Yes, but…” / “No, and…” formulas. |

---

## 3️⃣ Sequel Engine (Reactive)

| Beat     | Function                                        | Notes                        |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Reaction | Emotional + physiological response to disaster. | Keep authentic to bio & POV. |
| Dilemma  | Weigh limited / bad options.                    | Surface inner conflict.      |
| Decision | Choose next course → seeds next scene’s Goal.   | Shows agency.                |

## 4️⃣ Usage Guidelines

- **story-architect:** Ensure every outline alternates or balances scene & sequel beats.
- **scene-architect:** Mark beats on scene cards; note if a sequel is implied or explicit.
- **plot-expert:** Spot missing disasters or flat dilemmas that stall tension.
