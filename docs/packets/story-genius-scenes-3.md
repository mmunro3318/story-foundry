# Story Genius: Scene Development & Troubleshooting

> **Purpose:** Provide scene-focused agents with Cron’s tools for crafting and diagnosing emotionally charged story moments.

---

## 1️⃣ Scene Essentials

- Every scene must advance **both** plot and protagonist’s internal struggle.
- Ask: _Why does this matter right now, to this character, in light of their misbelief?_
- Causality is king — scenes exist only if they push the cause→effect chain.

---

## 2️⃣ The Four Core Questions

For each scene card or draft, answer:

1. What external event happens?
2. How does protagonist interpret it through their **misbelief**?
3. What action do they take as a result?
4. What consequences propel the next scene?

> **Agent Tip:** If a scene doesn’t pass this 4Q test, cut or revise.

---

## 3️⃣ Third Rail Integration

- Identify **Desire** at stake (surface want).
- Show how event threatens or tempts **misbelief**.
- Include a micro-realization or resistance — keep voltage alive.

## 4️⃣ Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem                | Likely Fix                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Scene feels flat       | Clarify link to misbelief; raise stakes.           |
| Plot-only event        | Add emotional charge via Third Rail lens.          |
| Overlong introspection | Tighten, let physical choices express inner state. |
| “Talking heads”        | Add pressure or risk to dialogue.                  |

---

## 5️⃣ Agent Usage

- **scene-architect:** Ensure scene cards note external + Third Rail beats.
- **editor:** Check transitions respect cause/effect logic.
- **writer-author:** Keep internal state visible via action, not just rumination.
