# Swain: Scaling & Pacing

> **Purpose:** Help agents vary narrative speed and intensity using Swain’s scene/sequel balance.

---

## 1️⃣ Why Pacing Matters

- A story’s heartbeat comes from **how quickly readers get payoff vs reflection**.
- Too many **scenes** → breathless but shallow.
- Too many **sequels** → bogged down, low tension.

> **Agent Tip:** Tune ratio to genre & story moment.

## 2️⃣ Ratios & Effects

| Ratio              | Effect               | Use When                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Heavy Scene (3:1)  | Fast, external drive | Action, thriller, climax   |
| Balanced (1:1)     | Even flow            | General narrative          |
| Heavy Sequel (1:3) | Slow, reflective     | Character study, aftermath |

> Apply per act or per micro-arc, not only globally.

## 3️⃣ Scaling Across Levels

- **Paragraph:** MRU pacing (tight for tension, looser for emotion).
- **Scene Pair:** Adjust sequel length after disaster to modulate tempo.
- **Act:** Map escalation — sequels grow shorter near climax.

---

## 4️⃣ Integration Tips

- **story-architect:** Plot ratio across story beats; ensure climax skews to scenes.
- **scene-architect:** Mark expected “breathing space” after heavy conflicts.
- **writer-author:** In prose, shorten or expand internal thought based on ratio.
