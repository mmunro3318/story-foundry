# Story Genius: Misbelief & Backstory

> **Purpose:** Equip backstory and structure agents with a focused toolkit for excavating the protagonist’s misbelief and weaving it into the plot.

---

## 1️⃣ Understanding the Misbelief

- A **misbelief** is a false idea about self/world learned through painful experience.
- It protects the character but blocks their true need.
- Story = forcing events that strip away the misbelief.

> **Agent Tip:** Treat the misbelief as a _design constraint_: every major choice must express, defend, or confront it.

---

## 2️⃣ Building the Backstory

### Origin Scene

- Moment when healthy belief was replaced by misbelief.
- Must include:
  - Setting, age, and relationships present.
  - Expectation → shattering event → new (false) conclusion.
- Write in 1st person (even if novel is not) to mine emotion.

### Crossroads (x3)

- Later moments that reinforced misbelief.
- Show decision under pressure → consequence → deeper commitment.

## 3️⃣ Packet Workflow

| Agent                | Task                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **backstory-expert** | Draft origin & crossroads scenes (≤1k each).    |
| **story-architect**  | Embed misbelief into global outline beats.      |
| **plot-expert**      | Ensure each future conflict will poke at wound. |

---

## 4️⃣ Implementation Tips

- Keep misbelief phrasing short & potent (“I’m unworthy,” “People always leave”).
- Link surface want to deeper need hidden behind misbelief.
- Don’t “fix” wound too soon — climax must pressure it to breaking.
