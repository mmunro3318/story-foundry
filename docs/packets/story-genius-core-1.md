# Story Genius: Core Philosophy & Third Rail

> **Purpose:** Give outlining and capture agents a concise guide to Cron’s psychology-first model and the “electric current” that powers every plot event.

---

## 1️⃣ Why Story Genius Differs

- Plot grows from **character psychology**, not external events.
- Every scene should be charged by an **emotional current**—Cron calls it the **Third Rail**.
- The protagonist’s _misbelief_ shapes choices; the story forces them to challenge or abandon it.

> **Agent Tip:** Before building any plot point, confirm its link to the hero’s inner struggle.

## 2️⃣ Core Principles

| Concept                 | Definition                                                                                          | Agent Use                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Third Rail**          | The live wire connecting surface events to the hero’s emotional need.                               | Ask: “Why does this matter to them now?” |
| **Misbelief**           | A false idea about self/world, formed in early wound, limiting growth.                              | Identify to anchor all stakes.           |
| **What-If Statement**   | “What if [character] who believes [misbelief] is forced to [situation] and must [inner challenge]?” | Jump-off for premise & outline.          |
| **Personal Investment** | Why this story matters to the author/hero.                                                          | Guides theme & tone.                     |

## 3️⃣ Agent Guidelines

- **story-architect:** Check that outlines show cause → effect **and** emotional voltage.
- **plot-expert:** Stress-test each plot event against the Third Rail — if it doesn’t provoke or pressure the misbelief, cut or revise.
- **backstory-expert:** Keep notes on when misbelief likely formed; feed to Packet 2.

---

## 4️⃣ Practical Workflow

1. Capture spark or concept from user.
2. Draft _What-If_ statement binding external stakes to inner wound.
3. Define hero’s misbelief & surface want.
4. Keep a visible “Third Rail” note in workspace for all beats.
