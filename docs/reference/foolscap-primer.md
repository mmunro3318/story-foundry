# Story Grid Foolscap Method - One Page Primer

## What Is the Foolscap Global Story Grid?

A one-page (legal-sized: 8.5" x 14") diagnostic tool that captures the essential macro-level elements of any story. **It's not a formula—it's a form that reveals whether your story fulfills its fundamental obligations to readers within genre expectations.** The foolscap serves as both a planning instrument and an editorial diagnostic, forcing you to distill your entire story into its most essential elements.

## The Seven Global Elements (Top Section)

### 1. Genre

- **Global Content Genre**: Primary category (Action, Thriller, Horror, Crime, Love, etc.)
- **Secondary Content Genre**: Supporting genre element
- **External Genre**: Surface-level plot category
- **Internal Genre**: Character's psychological journey (Maturation, Morality, Status, Worldview)

### 2. Conventions

Genre-specific requirements your story must include (alternate world rules, avatar types, catalysts)

### 3. Obligatory Moments

Must-have scenes that pay off reader expectations for your chosen genre

### 4. Point of View

Technical narrative choices combined with delivery method

### 5. Objects of Desire

- **Want**: What protagonist thinks they need (conscious)
- **Need**: What they actually require for growth (often unconscious)

### 6. Controlling Idea

The story's central message: **"[Positive/Negative outcome] happens when [cause/condition]"**

### 7. Quadrants

Four developmental stages showing how protagonist adapts to change

## Three-Act Structure Using Five Commandments

**Coyne's Key Insight: Start with the Climax first, then work backwards**

### Beginning Hook (~25%)

**Purpose**: Hook the reader into the story

- **Inciting Incident**: Event that launches the story
- **Progressive Complications**: Rising action and obstacles
- **Crisis**: Protagonist's first major difficult choice
- **Climax**: How they respond to the crisis
- **Resolution**: Immediate consequences

### Middle Build (~50%)

**Purpose**: Build progressive complications toward "all is lost moment"

- **Inciting Incident**: New problem that complicates original goal
- **Progressive Complications**: Escalating obstacles and setbacks
- **Crisis**: The protagonist's most difficult choice (best bad choice scenario)
- **Climax**: Their decision/action in response to crisis
- **Resolution**: Major setback or revelation (the "all is lost" moment)

### Ending Payoff (~25%)

**Purpose**: Deliver on promises made in Beginning Hook

- **Inciting Incident**: Final catalyst toward resolution
- **Progressive Complications**: Final obstacles before climax
- **Crisis**: Ultimate choice between want vs. need
- **Climax**: Final confrontation/action resolving primary conflict
- **Resolution**: How both external plot and internal arc conclude

## Value Tracking System

**For each of the 15 scenes (5 commandments × 3 acts), track:**

- **External Value Charge**: (+) or (-) movement toward protagonist's external goal
- **Internal Value Charge**: (+) or (-) movement in character's psychological development

**Value Spectrum Examples:**

- Action: Life → Death
- Love: Hate → Love
- Crime: Injustice → Justice
- Maturation: Naïveté → Wisdom

---

## Core Terminology (Coyne's Specific Language)

- **"Beginning Hook"** (not Act I) - Function: Hook reader
- **"Middle Build"** (not Act II) - Function: Build complications
- **"Ending Payoff"** (not Act III) - Function: Deliver on promises
- **"Units of Story"** - Individual components that must contribute to compelling whole
- **"All is lost moment"** - Major setback at end of Middle Build
- **"Form, not Formula"** - Diagnostic framework, not rigid template

## Step-by-Step Process

### Phase 1: Global Setup

1. Identify genres (global and secondary)
2. List genre conventions and obligatory moments
3. Choose point of view
4. Define objects of desire (want vs. need)
5. Articulate controlling idea
6. Map four developmental quadrants

### Phase 2: Structure Mapping

1. **Start with Ending Payoff climax** - How does story resolve?
2. Work backwards to Beginning Hook - What stakes launch the story?
3. Fill in Middle Build - What's the "all is lost" moment?
4. Apply Five Commandments to each section
5. Track value polarity shifts for all 15 core scenes

### Phase 3: Integration Check

1. Verify all genre conventions and obligatory moments are present
2. Confirm value progressions create proper emotional journey
3. Validate cause-and-effect story logic

## Key Applications

**For Planning**: Complete before writing to ensure structural soundness
**For Diagnosis**: Analyze existing drafts to identify problems
**For Revision**: Use as reference to realign scenes with core story
**For Collaboration**: Shared language between writers and editors

## Critical Success Factors

- **One-page constraint is mandatory** - If it doesn't fit, the story needs focus
- **Genre obligations must be met** - Readers have expectations based on genre choice
- **Value shifts must be clear** - Every scene should move story forward emotionally
- **Start with climax, work backwards** - Know where you're going before you begin
- **External and internal stories must connect** - Plot events must affect character psychology

The foolscap's power lies in forcing clarity about your story's essential elements while providing a diagnostic framework that reveals whether your story delivers on its promises to readers.
